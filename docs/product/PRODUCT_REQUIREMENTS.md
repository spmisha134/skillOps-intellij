# Product Requirements: BuildSkill Intellij for IntelliJ

## 1. Product summary

BuildSkill Intellij is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that creates and validates repository-scoped Codex/OpenAI skills.

The plugin is a deterministic project tool. It does not generate content through an LLM. It creates a correct skill folder structure, renders a small `SKILL.md`, creates required reference files, and validates the skill before reporting success.

## 2. Official structure target

The plugin must generate skills under:

```text
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/
```

Generated skills must follow this structure:

```text
.agents/
  skills/
    <skill-name>/
      SKILL.md
      references/
        instructions.md
        validation.md
        examples.md
      scripts/
      assets/
      agents/
        openai.yaml
```

## 2.1 Repository structure target

The plugin repository must follow the sibling reference structure from:

```text
../plugin-reference/sonarlint-intellij
```

Use the reference as a package and folder organization guide, not as a source of unrelated SonarLint behavior. This project must remain a single Gradle module:

```text
.
├── src/
├── docs/
└── gradle/
```

The `src` tree owns IntelliJ Platform integration, domain logic, templates, and tests. Keep the SonarLint-style separation by package: IDE integration in `actions`, `ui`, and `presentation`; reusable domain logic in `model`, `generator`, and `validator`.

## 3. Problem statement

Manual skill creation is error-prone.

Common mistakes:

- wrong folder location
- missing `SKILL.md`
- large `SKILL.md`
- missing front matter
- missing `name`
- missing `description`
- vague description
- missing reference files
- empty reference folders
- no validation checklist
- no examples
- no instruction to read repository-level agent instructions
- unsafe folder names
- duplicate skill folders

## 4. Product goal

The plugin must allow a developer to create a valid Codex/OpenAI skill from IntelliJ with minimal manual work.

The generated skill must be:

- stored under `.agents/skills/`
- small at the `SKILL.md` level
- supported by reference files
- validated immediately after generation
- safe to commit to the repository

## 5. Target user

The primary user is a developer using IntelliJ IDEA and Codex/OpenAI skills in a local repository.

The user wants repeatable skill creation without manually copying templates or remembering the correct folder structure.

## 6. Core workflow

```text
User right-clicks a project or folder
→ selects New → "BuildSkill"
→ enters skill name and description
→ plugin creates .agents/skills/<skill-name>/
→ plugin creates SKILL.md
→ plugin creates references files
→ plugin creates mandatory agents/openai.yaml
→ plugin creates optional scripts and assets folders
→ plugin validates generated skill
→ plugin shows success, warnings, or errors
```

## 7. Functional requirements

### 7.1 Create skill action

The plugin must add an IntelliJ project-view New-menu action:

```text
BuildSkill
```

The action must be available when the user right-clicks:

- project root
- any project directory

The action must not run when there is no open project.

### 7.2 Validate skill action

The plugin must add an IntelliJ project-view context menu action:

```text
Validate BuildSkill
```

The action must be available when the selected folder is either:

- a skill folder under `.agents/skills/`
- a project folder containing `.agents/skills/`

### 7.3 Skill creation dialog

The plugin must show a dialog with these fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| Skill name | Yes | Human-readable skill name |
| Description | Yes | Trigger-oriented description |
| Create scripts folder | No | Whether to create `scripts/` |
| Create assets folder | No | Whether to create `assets/` |

`agents/openai.yaml` is mandatory and must not be exposed as an optional checkbox.

### 7.4 Skill name normalization

The plugin must convert the skill name into a safe folder name.

Examples:

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| `PhotoAct Spec Writer` | `photoact-spec-writer` |
| `Kafka MCP Tool` | `kafka-mcp-tool` |
| `  My Skill  ` | `my-skill` |

Rules:

- trim leading and trailing spaces
- convert to lowercase
- replace whitespace with hyphens
- remove unsupported filesystem characters
- collapse repeated hyphens
- reject empty result

### 7.5 Generated `SKILL.md`

`SKILL.md` must stay small.

Generated template:

```markdown
---
name: <normalized-skill-name>
description: <description>
---

Use this skill when the task matches the description.

Before suggesting code structure, package layout, implementation approach, naming conventions, testing approach, or architectural changes, search the repository for project instruction files:

- `AGENTS.md` or `agents.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` or `claude.md`
- `GEMINI.md` or `gemini.md`

Treat those files as core project instructions. If they conflict with this skill, follow the project instruction files first.

Follow the workflow in `references/instructions.md`.

Before finishing, validate the output using `references/validation.md`.

Use `references/examples.md` when examples are needed.
```

### 7.6 Generated reference files

The plugin must always create the following files:

```text
references/instructions.md
references/validation.md
references/examples.md
```

These files must not be empty.

#### `references/instructions.md`

Must contain:

- purpose
- workflow
- implementation constraints
- project instruction discovery reminder
- output rules

#### `references/validation.md`

Must contain:

- validation checklist
- structural checks
- content quality checks
- final response checks

#### `references/examples.md`

Must contain:

- at least one good example placeholder
- at least one bad example placeholder
- guidance for adding project-specific examples

### 7.7 Support folders and files

The plugin must always create:

```text
agents/openai.yaml
```

The plugin may create these optional folders:

```text
scripts/
assets/
```

`agents/openai.yaml` must be valid YAML.

### 7.8 Duplicate handling

The plugin must not overwrite an existing skill directory.

If `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` already exists, the plugin must show:

```text
A skill folder with this name already exists.
```

### 7.9 Validation

Validation must check:

| Rule | Severity |
|---|---|
| skill is under `.agents/skills/` | Error |
| `SKILL.md` exists | Error |
| front matter exists | Error |
| `name` exists | Error |
| `description` exists | Error |
| description is not blank | Error |
| `SKILL.md` is small | Warning |
| `references/instructions.md` exists | Error |
| `references/validation.md` exists | Error |
| `references/examples.md` exists | Error |
| reference files are not empty | Warning |
| project instruction discovery exists | Error |
| safe skill folder name | Error |
| `agents/openai.yaml` exists | Error |
| `agents/openai.yaml` is valid YAML | Warning |

### 7.10 User feedback

Success:

```text
Codex skill created successfully.
```

Warning:

```text
Skill created with warnings:
- SKILL.md is larger than expected.
- references/examples.md contains only placeholder examples.
```

Error:

```text
Could not create skill: A skill folder with this name already exists.
```

## 8. Non-functional requirements

### 8.1 Local-first

The plugin must work without internet access.

### 8.2 Deterministic behavior

The plugin must not require an LLM to generate or validate the skill.

### 8.3 Safe writes

The plugin must not overwrite files silently.

### 8.4 Testability

Core logic must be testable without launching IntelliJ.

Testable components:

- skill name normalization
- path resolution
- template rendering
- validation rules

### 8.5 Maintainability

IntelliJ-specific code must be separated from domain logic.

## 9. Out of scope

The product does not include:

- OpenAI API calls
- local LLM integration
- remote official documentation fetching
- automatic AI repair
- marketplace publishing automation as product behavior
- custom editor inspections
- project-wide skill indexing

Publishing operations are documented in the runbook, not implemented as product behavior.

## 10. Acceptance criteria

The first complete version is done when:

- `./gradlew runIde` starts the sandbox IDE
- `BuildSkill` appears in the project-view New menu
- `Validate BuildSkill` appears for skill folders
- a skill is generated under `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`
- `SKILL.md` is generated and small
- required reference files are generated
- duplicate skill folders are rejected
- generated skill is validated
- validation messages are actionable
- core logic has unit tests
